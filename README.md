## Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to the project: logging bugs, submitting pull requests on this GitHub, and reporting issues and making suggestions in Live2D Community.

### Forking And Pull Requests

We very much appreciate your pull requests, whether they bring fixes, improvements, or even new features. Note, however, that the wrapper is designed to be as lightweight and shallow as possible and should therefore only be subject to bug fixes and memory/performance improvements. To keep the main repository as clean as possible, create a personal fork and feature branches there as needed.

### Bugs

We are regularly checking issue-reports and feature requests at Live2D Community. Before filing a bug report, please do a search in Live2D Community to see if the issue-report or feature request has already been posted. If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction.

### Suggestions

We're also interested in your feedback for the future of the SDK. You can submit a suggestion or feature request at Live2D Community. To make this process more effective, we're asking that you include more information to help define them more clearly.
