# Cubism Web Samples for TypeScript

This is a sample implementation of an application implemented with TypeScript.


## Development environment

| Package | Version |
| --- | --- |
| TypeScript | 5.0.4 |
| Webpack | 5.82.1 |

For other packages, check the `package.json` for each project.
For other development environments and operation environments, see [README.md](/README.md) in the top directory.


## Task list

### `npm: start`

Starts a local server for development and creates a project monitor build.
Any changes you make to the project will automatically rebuild and cause the browser to reload.
You can debug in Visual Studio Code from [Debug Project].

To terminate in Visual Studio Code, type `>Tasks: Terminate Task` and select the task from the command palette.

### `npm: build`

Outputs a TypeScript build deliverable to the `dist` directory.
The output is a JavaScript file that has been bundled into one using Webpack.

You can change the settings by editing `tsconfig.json` and `webpack.config.js`.

### `npm: build:prod`

Creates above build after optimizing it.
It is used to output deliverables for production environments as it reduces the build size.

### `npm: test`

Performs a TypeScript type check test.

You can change the settings by editing `tsconfig.json`.

### `npm: lint`

Performs static analysis of TypeScript files in the `src` directory.

You can change the settings by editing `.eslintrc.yml`.

### `npm: lint:fix`

Performs static analysis and automatic modification of TypeScript files in the `src` directory.

You can change the settings by editing `.eslintrc.yml`.

### `npm: serve`

Starts a simple local server.
You can check the index.html by accessing `/Samples/TypeScript/Demo` in the server from your browser.
The project needs to be built in advance.

Deliverables can be verified in an environment close to the production environment.

### `npm: clean`

Deletes the build deliverable directory (`dist`).
